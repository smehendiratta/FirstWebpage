     <h1>What is an E-Mail</h1>
	 <p>Electronic mail (or e-mail or email) is an Internet service that allows those people who have an e-mail address (accounts) to send and receive electronic letters. Those are much like postal letters, except that they are delivered much faster than snail mail when sending over long distances, and are usually free.</p>
	 <h1>Parts of an email message</h1>
	 <p>Email messages, like other forms of correspondence, have the same general format regardless of the email program you choose. Below is an image of an email message from Zimbra, the St. Edward’s University Webmail. There is a header, a subject line, body of the message, and the signature line.<br></p>
	 <img src="message-box.jpg">
     <h2>To:</h2><p> The To field is required in all email messages to alert the mail server to the message's destination.</p>

      <br><br><h2>From:</h2> <p>The form field will give the recipient of the email an idea whom the message is from.</p>

      <br><br><h2>Some other fields that you might see are:</h2>  

    <br><br><h2>Cc:</h2><p> The CC field allows you to send the same message to multiple recipients. When you send a Cc: message, all recipients are aware of who received copies of the message. Cc: stands for carbon copy and is a holdover from the days when letters were typed with carbon paper between the pages to create identical letters for multiple recipients.</p>
    <br><br><h2>Bcc:</h2><p> The Bcc field allows you to send an identical message to multiple recipients, however, those recipients whose addresses appear in the BCC: field cannot be seen by the other recipients.</p>

    <br><br><h2>Subject lines:</h2><p> It help the recipient focus on the topic of your message.</p>

   <br><br><h2>Signature Line:</h2><p> At the end of a message, you may see a block of information such as name, title, business address, phone numbers, web addresses, and sometimes even quotes from famous (or infamous) people. This block of information can be inserted in a standardized format (so you do not have to type it every time you mail a message) by using a signature file (also known as a .sig file).</p>
     <h1>Common Terminologies</h1>
	 <h2>What is a user id</h2>
	 <p>
     User identification (user ID) is a logical entity used to identify a user on a software, system, website or within any generic IT environment. It is used within any IT enabled system to identify and distinguish between the users who access or use it.
     A user ID may also be termed as username or user identifier.
    </p>
	 <h2>Password</h2>
	 <p>To prevent other people from using your account via your userid, you are required to have a password. A password allows you and only you to access the computer system through your userid. It basically proves to the computer system that you are who you say you are.</p>
	 <h2>Email Address</h2>
	 <p>A name that identifies an electronic post office box on a network where e-mail can be sent. Different types of networks have different formats for e-mail addresses. On the Internet, all e-mail addresses have the form:
     @<domain name >
     For example,
     webmaster@sandybay.com</p>
	 <h2>Newsgroup</h2>
	 <p>A newsgroup is a discussion about a particular subject consisting of notes written to a central Internet site and redistributed through Usenet, a worldwide network of news discussion groups.</p>
	 <h2>Chat room</h2>
	 <p>A chat room is a Web site, part of a Web site, or part of an online service such as America Online, that provides a venue for communities of users with a common interest to communicate in real time.</p>
	 <h2>MIME</h2>
	 <p>Short for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, a specification for formatting non-ASCII messages so that they can be sent over the Internet. Many e-mail clients now support MIME, which enables them to send and receive graphics, audio, and video files via the Internet mail system. In addition, MIME supports messages in character sets other than ASCII.</p>

	 <h1>Advantages of Email</h1>
	 <br><h2>1. It's free!</h2>

     <p>Once you’re online, there is no further expense.</p>

     <br><h2>2. Easy to reference</h2>

<p>Sent and received messages and attachments can be stored safely, logically and reliably.  It's a lot easier to organize emails than paper.</p>

<br><h2>3. Easy to use</h2>

<p>Once you’re set up, sending and receiving messages is simple. That goes for a host of other email functions. Data storage and contacts can be accessed quickly and easily.</p>

<br><h2>4. Easy to prioritize</h2>

<p>Incoming messages have subject lines that mean you can delete without opening. How much time does that save compared to ‘snail mail?’</p>

<br><h2>5. Speed</h2>

<p>Message to send? Done, under a second! Email is as fast a form of written communication as any.</p>

<br><h2>6. Global</h2>

<p>Web based email means you can access your messages anywhere online. Going overseas? Before you go, mail yourself a copy of your passport number, travel insurance details or your accommodation details.</p>

<br><h2>7. Good for the planet</h2>

<p>Actually the advantages and disadvantages of email are clear here. Computers themselves aren’t 'green', but email offsets some of the damage by reducing the environmental cost of contact.</p>

<br><h2>8. Info at your fingertips</h2>

<p>Storing data online means less large, space taking file cabinets, folders and shelves. You can access information far quicker if you learn how to use email this way.</p>

<br><h2>9. Leverage</h2>

<p>Send the same message to any number of people. Adaptations are simple, too. If you have a product or service to sell, email is an effective medium to get your message out.</p>

<br><h2>10. Send reminders to yourself</h2>

<p>Do you use more than one account? Email yourself messages from work to home or vice versa. Does the idea of two or more accounts seem complicated? It's not if you know how to manage multiple accounts.</p>
	 <h1>Disadvantages of email</h1>
	 <br><h2>1. Emotional responses </h2>

<p>Some emails cause upset or anger. A reply in the heat of the moment can’t be easily retracted, but it can cause lasting damage.</p>

<br><h2>2. Information overload</h2>

<p>Too many people send too much information. They cover their backs citing ‘need to know’ as the justification. Learn how to use email effectively and you’ll reduce time wasted on this.</p>

<br><h2>3. Lacking the Personal Touch </h2>

<p>Some things are best left untyped. Email will never beat a hand written card or letter when it comes to relationships.</p>

<br><h2>4. Misunderstandings</h2>

<p>Emails from people who don’t take the time to read what they write before clicking ‘send’. Time is wasted, either to clarify or, worse, acting on a misinterpretation of the message.</p>

<br><h2>5. No Respite </h2>

<p>Your email inbox is like a garden; it needs to be constantly maintained. Leave it and will continue to grow. Ignore it at your peril! </p>

<br><h2>6. Pressure to Reply</h2>

<p>Once it’s in your inbox, you feel an ever increasing obligation to act on it. Procrastinating doesn’t making it go away.  Do it, dump it or delegate it.</p>

<br><h2>7. Spam</h2>

<p>Having to deal with spam and spoofs is one of the worst avoidable time wasters online.  Use some anti spam software.</p>

<br><h2>8. Sucks up Your Time</h2>

<p>Over checking messages is so common, but it is time wasted on a low value, passive activity.  Better to check once or twice a day.</p>

<br><h2>9. Too Long</h2>

<p>How long is too long? It’s hard to say exactly, but the longer it goes on, the harder it is to take in. Email is suited to brevity - keep it short and sweet.</p>

<br><h2>10. Viruses</h2>

<p>A virus could seriously affect your computer. If you want to know how to use email effectively, it's worth learning how to deal with these.</p>
