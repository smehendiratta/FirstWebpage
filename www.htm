 <h1>Is Internet and the World WideWeb the same?</h1>
 <p>Many people use the terms Internet and World Wide Web (aka. the Web) interchangeably, but in fact the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two separate but related things.
 The Internet is the physical network of computers all over the world. The World Wide Web is a virtual network of websites connected by hyperlinks (or "links").
 </p>
 <h1>Defination</h1>
 <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a network of online content that is formatted in HTML and accessed via HTTP. The term refers to all the interlinked HTML pages that can be accessed over the Internet. The World Wide Web was originally designed in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee while he was a contractor at CERN.

The World Wide Web is most often referred to simply as "the Web."</p>
<h1>Web browser</h1>
<p>A web browser is a computer program application found on all modern computers. They are also now a common feature of mobile phones or other mobile devices and tablet computers like the iPad or Android tablets.

Web browsers are used by people to find and look at web sites on the Internet. The first web browser was created in 1990. Many different web browsers are available for free. All web browsers can go to websites but each browser has good things and bad things about it. For example, some browsers focus on data security and keeping computers safe from viruses. Other browsers are made so that web pages appear on screen faster.

Some popular web browsers available to download:

    <li>Camino</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
    <li>Opera</li>
    <li>Safari</li>
    </ul>
	</p>
	<h1>Search Engines</h1>
	 <img src="seimg.jpg">
	 <p>The main purpose of a search engine is to search for information on the Internet.  They are software programs that search for websites based on keywords that the user types in.  The search engine then goes through their databases of information in order to locate the information you are looking for. The main search engines currently be used are Google, Bing, and Yahoo.</p>
	 <h2>Working of a search engine</h2>

	 <source src="working of se.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	 </video>
	 <h1>Web Diretories</h1>
	 <p>A web directory is not a search engine and does not display lists of web pages based on keywords; instead, it lists web sites by category and subcategory.[3] Most web directory entries are also not found by web crawlers but by humans.[2] The categorization is usually based on the whole web site rather than one page or a set of keywords, and sites are often limited to inclusion in only a few categories.</p>
	 <h1>Meta Search Engines</h1>
     <p>A meta search engine is a type of search engine that gives results based on a combination of results from other search engine databases. It specializes in concatenating databases from a variety of search engines and linking search results to relevant sources.</p>
	 <h1>Common Terminologies</h1>
	 <h2>Telnet</h2>
	 <img src="telnet.jpg">
	 <p>Telnet (TN) is a networking protocol and software program used to access remote computers and terminals over the Internet or a TCP/IP computer network. 
	     Designed for remote server access, management and client/server architectures, Telnet works through a purpose-built program that provides connectivity between a remote computer/server and host computer.</p>
	 <h2>FTP</h2>
	 <img src="ftp.jpg" height=375 width=400>
	 <p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a client/server protocol used for transferring files to or exchanging files with a host computer. It may be authenticated with user names and passwords. Anonymous FTP allows users to access files, programs and other data from the Internet without the need for a user ID or password. 
	      FTP is also the Internet standard for moving or transferring files from one computer to another using TCP or IP networks.</p>
	  <h2>Plug ins</h2>
	 <p>A plug-in is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing software application. When an application supports plug-ins, it enables customization. The common examples are the plug-ins used in web browsers to add new features such as search-engines, virus scanners, or the ability to utilize a new file type such as a new video format</p>
	 <h1>How to setup a webpage</h1>
	 <p>To create a Web site , you will need three items: a domain name, a hosting account and content. Below is a breakdown of what each is:</p>
	 <br><h2>Domain name:</h2>
	 <p>A domain name is what you type in or click to get to a web site, For example www.ccgateway.com.au. </p>
	 <br><h2>Web Site Hosting Account:</h2>
	 <p>Your web site then needs to be hosted, basically it is a folder on a computer that contain the contents of your web site. That folder is then available to every one that browses to your domain name. </p>
	 <br><h2>Contents:</h2>
	 <p>Content is what people see when they go to your Web site. You are visiting this site, and what you can see on this page, as well as the linked pages is content. The simplest form of content is in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files, little scripts that tell your browser what to show when someone views your site.</p>
	 <br><br><h2>How it all works:</h2>
	 <p>Typing the URL or clicking a link and seeing what you want is like turning on a light switch. You may not know why, but the light goes on! Here's what is actually going on under the hood: </p>
	 <br><ul>
	    
    <li>You type a URL into your browser and click the "go" button.</li>
    <li>The browser queries a Name Server to find the actual location of the files it is looking for</li>
    <li>It is redirected to the folder somewhere in the world that contains the files</li>
    <li>It downloads the HTML file from that folder and saves a copy on your computer</li>
    <li>It reads that file to see if it should download anything else, like pictures</li>
    <li>It uses the script to decide how to display everything -- text, pictures or music</li>
    <li>You see the content in your browser window</li>
	 </ul>
	 <p>And now you know how Web pages work.</p>
