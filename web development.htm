  <h1>Definition</h1>
  <p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
  <h1>Choosing the right programming language</h1>
  <p>When it comes to the perfect programming language for the development of your site, it is imperative that you understand that there is no perfect programming language. Once you understand this, it is simply a matter of choosing the language that best serves your needs. Before you decide on what language to use, you should consider the following
    <ul>
    <li>your server platform</li>
    <li>the server software you run</li>
    <li>your budget</li>
    <li>previous experience in programming</li>
    <li>the database you have chosen for your backend</li>
    </ul>
	<p>Some of the most popular languages are discussed below.</p>
	</p>
    <h1>HTML</h1>
	<img src="html.jpg">
	<p>HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like < html >). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like < h1 > and < / h1 >, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example < img >.</p>
    <p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>

     <br>
	 <br><br><h1>CSS</h1>
	 <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>
     <p> Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
	 <p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
	 <p>This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .</p>

	 <br><br><h1>Java Script</h1>
	 <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language.It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.</p>
	 <p> With the rise of the single-page web app and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages.</p>
     <p>Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and design are influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages.</p>

	 <br><br><h1>XML</h1>
	 <img src="xml.jpg" height=200 width=200>
	 <p>The Extensible Markup Language (short XML) is a computer language. It is a markup language like HTML but is extensible. It's created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XML defines rules for the construction of a document. XML adds context to the information in a document. It does not say how this should be displayed.</p>
	 <p>Some programs get information out of an XML-document. To do that, they need an API. There are many APIs for XML.
     You can write a description of an XML document in a way that is useful for programmers. There are several languages for this; the best known is called DTD.</p>
