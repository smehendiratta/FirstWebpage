		 <p>The Internet is a large group of computers that are connected to each other. The Internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world. It has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks and websites, which together carry many different kinds of information (facts and details) and services. So in other words, the Internet is a network of networks.</p>
          <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/">History of internet</a>
		  <h1>Who owns the internet</h1>
          <p>No one actually owns the Internet, and no single person or organization controls the Internet in its entirety. The Internet is more of a concept than an actual tangible entity, and it relies on a physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks.</p>

          <h1>Different modes of connecting to internet</h1>	
           <p><h3>Wireless:</h3><br>

<p>Radio frequency bands are used in place of telephone or cable networks. One of the greatest advantages of wireless Internet connections is the “always-on” connection that can be accessed from any location that falls within network coverage. Wireless connections are made possible through the use of a modem, which picks up Internet signals and sends them to other devices.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mobile:</h3><br>

<p>Many cell phone and smartphone providers offer voice plans with Internet access. Mobile Internet connections provide good speeds and allow you to access the Internet on the go.</p>

<br><h3>Hotspots:</h3><br>

<p>Hotspots are sites that offer Internet access over a wireless local area network (WLAN) by way of a router that then connects to an Internet service provider. Hotspots utilize Wi-Fi technology, which allows electronic devices to connect to the Internet or exchange data wirelessly through radio waves. Hotspots can be phone-based or free-standing, commercial or free to the public.</p>

<br><h3>Dial-Up:</h3><br>

<p>Dial-up connections require users to link their phone line to a computer in order to access the Internet. This particular type of connection—also referred to as analog—does not permit users to make or receive phone calls through their home phone service while using the Internet.</p>

<br><h3>Broadband:</h3><br>

<p>This high-speed Internet connection is provided through either cable or telephone companies. One of the fastest options available, broadband Internet uses multiple data channels to send large quantities of information. The term broadband is shorthand for broad bandwidth. Broadband Internet connections such as DSL and cable are considered high-bandwidth connections. Although many DSL connections can be considered broadband, not all broadband connections are DSL.</p>

<br><h3>DSL:</h3><br>

<p>DSL, which stands for Digital Subscriber Line, uses existing 2-wire copper telephone line connected to one’s home so service is delivered at the same time as landline telephone service. Customers can still place calls while surfing the Internet.</p>

<br><h3>Cable:</h3><br>

<p>Cable Internet connection is a form of broadband access. Through use of a cable modem, users can access the Internet over cable TV lines. Cable modems can provide extremely fast access to the Internet.</p>

<br><h3>Satellite:</h3><br>

<p>In certain areas where broadband connection is not yet offered, a satellite Internet option may be available. Similar to wireless access, satellite connection utilizes a modem.</p>

<br><h3>ISDN:</h3><br>

<p>ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) allows users to send data, voice and video content over digital telephone lines or standard telephone wires. The installation of an ISDN adapter is required at both ends of the transmission—on the part of the user as well as the Internet access provider.</p>

<br><br>There are quite a few other Internet connection options available, including T-1 lines, T-3 lines, OC (Optical Carrier) and other DSL technologies.</br></p>		  
		<h1>Common Terminologies</h1>
		<h2>IP address</h2>
		<p>The Internet Protocol is a set of rules for sending information between computers on the Internet. Each computer that uses the Internet Protocol has at least one IP address that identifies it to all other devices on the planet, just like a person might have a postal address.

This set of rules is like a language, but in computer science it is a protocol. A board of engineers has defined some of those protocols, which sit on top of each other (that's called layered architecture). On top of the Internet protocol there is the Transmission Control Protocol and the User Datagram Protocol (and some others). Below it, there are protocols of the Network layer, like Ethernet.

At the moment there are two versions of the Internet Protocol being used. One is called IP Version 4 (IPv4), the other one is called IP Version 6 (IPv6).</p>
		<h2>ISP(Internet Service Providers)</h2>
		<p>An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.

Internet services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, Usenet service, colocation.</p>
		<h2>Internet Congestion or Internet bottleneck</h2>
		<img src="congestion.jpg" height="200" width="400">
         <p>Internet bottlenecks are places in telecommunication networks in which internet service providers (ISPs), or naturally occurring high use of the network, slow or alter the network speed of the users and/or content producers using that network. A bottleneck is a more general term for a system that has been reduced or slowed due to limited resources or components. The bottleneck occurs in a network when there are too many users attempting to access a specific resource. Internet bottlenecks provide artificial and natural network choke points to inhibit certain sets of users from overloading the entire network by consuming too much bandwidth. Theoretically, this will lead users and content producers through alternative paths to accomplish their goals while limiting the network load at any one time.</p>	
		 <h2>DNS(Domain Name System)</h2>
		 <p>Domain Name System (or Service or Server), an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. Because domain names are alphabetic, they're easier to remember. The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, therefore, a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP address. For example, the domain name www.example.com might translate to 198.105.232.4.

The DNS system is, in fact, its own network. If one DNS server doesn't know how to translate a particular domain name, it asks another one, and so on, until the correct IP address is returned.</p>
		 <h1>Advantages of Internet</h1>
		 <img src="iadvantages.jpg">
		 <p>1) Information on almost every subject imaginable.
<br>2) Powerful search engines
<br>3) Ability to do research from your home versus research libraries.
<br>4) Information at various levels of study. Everything from scholarly articles to ones directed at children.
<br>5) Message boards where people can discuss ideas on any topic. Ability to get wide range of opinions. People can find others that have a similar interest in whatever they are interested in.
<br>6) The internet provides the ability of emails. Free mail service to anyone in the country.
<br>7) Platform for products like SKYPE, which allow for holding a video conference with anyone in the world who also has access.
<br>8) Friendships and love connections have been made over the internet by people involved in love/passion over similar interests.
<br>9) Things such as Yahoo Answers and other sites where kids can have readily available help for homework.
<br>10) News, of all kinds is available almost instantaneously. Commentary, on that news, from every conceivable viewpoint is also available. </p>
		 <h1>Disadvantages of internet</h1>
		 <img src="idisadvantages.jpg">
		 <p>1) There is a lot of wrong information on the internet. Anyone can post anything, and much of it is garbage.
<br>2) There are predators that hang out on the internet waiting to get unsuspecting people in dangerous situations.
<br>3) Some people are getting addicted to the internet and thus causing problems with their interactions of friends and loved ones.
<br>4) Pornography that can get in the hands of young children too easily.
<br>5) Easy to waste a lot of time on the internet. You can start surfing, and then realize far more time has passed than you realized. Internet and television together of added to the more sedentary lifestyles of people which further exacerbates the obesity problem.
<br>6) Internet has a lot of "cheater" sites. People can buy essays and pass them off as their own far more easily than they used to be able to do.
<br>7) There are a lot of unscrupulous businesses that have sprung up on the internet to take advantage of people.
<br>8) Hackers can create viruses that can get into your personal computer and ruin valuable data.
<br>9) Hackers can use the internet for identity theft.
<br>10) It can be quite depressing to be on the internet and realize just how uneducated so many people have become in today's society. </p>
