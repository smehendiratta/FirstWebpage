<h1>Internet security</h1>
<p>Internet security is a tree branch of computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing.Different methods have been used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption.</p>
<h1>What is encryption</h1>
<img src="encryption.jpg">
<p>Encryption is the process of using an algorithm to transform information to make it unreadable for unauthorized users. This cryptographic method protects sensitive data such as credit card numbers by encoding and transforming information into unreadable cipher text. This encoded data may only be decrypted or made readable with a key.Symmetric-key and asymmetric-key are the two primary types of encryption.<br>Two encryption schemes are as follows:  </p>
<h2>1. Symmetric Encryption</h2>
<p>
Definition - What does Symmetric Encryption mean?

Symmetric encryption is a form of computerized cryptography using a singular encryption key to guise an electronic message. Its data conversion uses a mathematical algorithm along with a secret key, which results in the inability to make sense out of a message. Symmetric encrpytion is a two-way algorithm because the mathematical algorithm is reversed when decrypting the message along with using the same secret key.

Symmetric encryption is also known as private-key encryption and secure-key encryption.</p>
<h2>2. Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<p>It is a cryptographic system that uses two keys -- a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message.For ex- When John wants to send a secure message to Jane, he uses Jane's public key to encrypt the message. Jane then uses her private key to decryptit.<br>An important element to the public key system is that the public and private keys are related in such a way that only the public key can be used to encrypt messages and only the corresponding private key can be used to decrypt them. Moreover, it is virtually impossible to deduce the private key if you know the public key.</p>
<h1>Concept of digital signature</h1>
<p>A digital signature guarantees the authenticity of an electronic document or message in digital communication and uses encryption techniques to provide proof of original and unmodified documentation. <br>Digital signatures are used in e-commerce, software distribution, financial transactions and other situations that rely on forgery or tampering detection techniques.</p>
<h2>How is digital signature applied and verified</h2>
<p>
<ul>   
   <li>The document or message sender (signer) or public/private key supplier shares the public key with the end user(s).</li>
    <li>The sender, using his private key, appends the encrypted signature to the message or document.</li>
    <li>The end user decrypts the document and verifies the signature, which lets the end user know that the document is from the original sender.</li>
</ul>
</p>	
	<h1>Firewall</h1>
	<img src="firewall.jpg">
	<p>A firewall is software used to maintain the security of a private network. Firewalls block unauthorized access to or from private networks and are often employed to prevent unauthorized Web users or illicit software from gaining access to private networks connected to the Internet. A firewall may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of both.

A firewall is recognized as the first line of defense in securing sensitive information. For better safety. </p>
	<h1>There are generally two types of firewalls:</h1>
	<h2>Software firewalls</h2>
	<p>Software firewalls are the most popular network protection method for home users. They usually come as stand-alone applications or as part of a complete anti virus protection software, such as the one BullGuard provides. Besides providing protection for inbound and outbound traffic, a software firewall can also protect against Trojan or Worm applications and allows various options of control over its functions and features.
     A reliable software firewall should run in the background of your computer and leave a small print on overall performance by using few of its resources. </p>
	<h2>Hardware firewalls</h2>
	<p>Hardware firewalls are built into network devices such as routers and can protect every single machine on a network and require little configuration to work effectively. They use packet filtering techniques to examine the header of a packet, determining his source and destination and then, comparing the data to a set of predefined rules, they decide whether to drop the packet or forward it to the next step or to its destination.</p>
	<h1>Firewall generally uses two or more of the following methods:</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
	
<li>    Packet Filtering: Firewalls filter packets that attempt to enter or leave a network and either accept or reject them depending on the predefined set of filter rules.</li>
    <li>Application Gateway: The application gateway technique employs security methods applied to certain applications such as Telnet and File Transfer Protocol servers.</li>
    <li>Circuit-Level Gateway: A circuit-level gateway applies these methods when a connection such as Transmission Control Protocol is established and packets start to move.</li>
    <li>Proxy Servers: Proxy servers can mask real network addresses and intercept every message that enters or leaves a network.</li>
    <li>Stateful Inspection or Dynamic Packet Filtering: This method compares not just the header information, but also a packetâ€™s most important inbound and outbound data parts. These are then compared to a trusted information database for characteristic matches. This determines whether the information is authorized to cross the firewall into the network.</li>
